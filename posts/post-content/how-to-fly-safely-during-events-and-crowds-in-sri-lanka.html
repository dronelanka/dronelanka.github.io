<h1>How to Fly Safely During Events and Crowds in Sri Lanka</h1>
<p>Flying drones over weddings, rallies, and festivals can capture unforgettable aerial perspectives, but such operations in Sri Lanka demand rigorous adherence to regulatory, safety, and cultural protocols. The following guide outlines legal requirements, pre-flight planning, in-flight best practices, and post-flight obligations to ensure safe, compliant drone operations amid crowds.</p>

<h2>Regulatory Compliance and Approvals</h2>
<p>All camera-equipped drones must be registered with the <a href="https://www.caa.lk/" target="_blank">Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL)</a>, and operators of Category A, B, or C drones require formal authorization prior to any flight over public events.</p>
<p>For every event, the drone operator—not the client or event organizer—must apply for operational approval using <a href="https://www.caa.lk/en/cadec/2-uncategorised/438-manual-drone-applications" target="_blank">CAASL Form CAA/AS/017</a>, attaching:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Security clearance from the <a href="https://www.ocds.lk/" target="_blank">Office of the Chief of Defence Staff (OCDS)</a></li>
    <li>Third-party liability insurance evidence, meeting CAASL minimum cover requirements</li>
    <li>Detailed flight plan with GPS coordinates, dates, times, and consent letters from venue authorities</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications should be submitted well in advance—at least 10 working days before the event—to accommodate inter-agency clearances.</p>

<h2>Restricted Zones and Crowd Safety Distances</h2>
<p>Operating over organized public gatherings without explicit CAASL approval is an offence. Even with approval, maintain the following minimum safety buffers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>100 meters from any organized open-air assembly or congested area</li>
    <li>50 meters horizontally from any person, vehicle, or structure</li>
    <li>30 meters during take-off and landing</li>
</ul>
<p>These distances preserve crowd safety and reduce the risk of injury in the event of malfunction.</p>

<h2>Pre-Flight Planning</h2>
<p>Thorough preparation underpins safe operations amid crowds:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Site Survey: Identify launch and recovery zones that are clear of attendees and obstacles.</li>
    <li>Weather Assessment: Confirm favorable conditions—low wind speeds, no precipitation, and adequate visibility—using reliable forecasts.</li>
    <li>Equipment Inspection: Verify propeller integrity, battery health, firmware currency, and gimbal functionality.</li>
    <li>Observer Coordination: Assign a dedicated spotter to monitor airspace and crowd proximity, ensuring continuous unaided visual line of sight (VLOS).</li>
    <li>Emergency Procedures: Pre-designate safe landing zones away from crowds and establish lost-link protocols.</li>
</ol>

<h2>In-Flight Best Practices</h2>
<p>During the event, adhere to stringent operational conduct:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maintain VLOS at all times; never rely solely on first-person view (FPV) systems.</li>
    <li>Fly at altitudes that respect venue sightlines and avoid hovering directly above spectators or ceremonial processions.</li>
    <li>Use smooth, predictable flight paths—gentle orbits and steady reveals—to minimize startling attendees.</li>
    <li>Monitor battery levels vigilantly; plan the mission to conclude with at least 30 percent reserve capacity.</li>
    <li>Avoid abrupt maneuvers; sudden altitude changes can cause alarm among participants and jeopardize stability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Event-Specific Considerations</h2>
<p><strong>Weddings:</strong> Indoor coverage mandates CAASL approval and venue consent. Avoid flying within enclosed halls; opt for outdoor courtyard or rooftop approaches when permissible.</p>
<p><strong>Festivals and Rallies:</strong> High-density crowds and noise can disorient both drone and pilot. Maintain extra lateral separation and consider higher altitudes (within permitted limits) to reduce disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Refrain from flying near religious rites or over processions involving ceremonial animals (e.g., temple elephants), as drones can disrupt rituals and provoke safety risks.</p>

<h2>Post-Flight Obligations</h2>
<p>After landing, operators must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Report any incident or accident to <a href="https://www.caa.lk/en/drones" target="_blank">CAASL</a> using Form CAA/AS/018 within 48 hours and notify the nearest police station.</li>
    <li>Securely store flight logs, approval letters, and insurance documents for audit purposes.</li>
    <li>De-brief with the event organizer to review any operational concerns and improve future safety protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adhering to these guidelines harmonizes creative aerial storytelling with Sri Lanka’s regulatory framework and crowd safety imperatives, ensuring that drone footage enhances events without compromising participant well-being or legal compliance.</p>
