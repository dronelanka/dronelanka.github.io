<p>Booking a professional drone shoot involves more than simply scheduling a flight. From legal compliance to creative deliverables, clients often have many concerns before committing. This FAQ-style guide addresses the ten most common questions prospective clients ask when arranging drone services in Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2>1. Do you have the necessary licenses and certifications to fly commercially in Sri Lanka?</h2>
<p>All commercial drone operations in Sri Lanka require registration with the <a href="https://www.caa.lk/en/" target="_blank">Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL)</a> and appropriate pilot certification. Operators of camera-equipped drones must hold a <a href="https://www.caa.lk/en/drones" target="_blank">CAASL-issued permit</a> and, if applicable, a <a href="https://www.caa.lk/en/drones" target="_blank">Remote Pilot License under CAASL regulations</a>. Foreign operators no longer require Ministry of Defence security clearance but must still <a href="https://www.caa.lk/en/drones" target="_blank">register online with CAASL</a> at least 10 working days before the shoot<sup><a href="#citation-1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>2. Is your drone registered with CAASL, and do you have the required flight permits?</h2>
<p>Every camera-equipped drone—regardless of weight—must be registered with CAASL. Prior to any shoot, operators submit a detailed flight plan including GPS coordinates, dates, times, and insurance details through the <a href="https://www.caa.lk/en/drones" target="_blank">CAASL portal</a>. Drones in Categories A–C (above 200 g) need third-party liability insurance and CAASL approval; even small camera drones under 200 g require registration and permission<sup><a href="#citation-2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>3. What experience do you have, and can you provide samples of your work?</h2>
<p>Clients should always request a pilot’s portfolio or showreel demonstrating relevant aerial cinematography experience. Look for examples of similar projects—real estate tours, event coverage, or tourism videos—to gauge creative style and technical skill. A transparent operator will happily share video excerpts or photo galleries along with client references<sup><a href="#citation-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>4. What equipment and camera setup will you use?</h2>
<p>Professional drone operators typically use commercial-grade platforms (e.g., DJI Mavic 3, Inspire 3) equipped with 4K–8K sensors and gimbals for stabilized footage. Clients should ask about lens options, ND filter availability, and onboard systems (such as RTK for precision mapping) to ensure the chosen setup meets project objectives and image-quality standards<sup><a href="#citation-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>5. How do you navigate restricted airspace and no-fly zones?</h2>
<p>Sri Lanka’s no-fly and restricted areas include aerodrome zones, military bases, national parks, archaeological sites, and dense urban gatherings. Operators must consult <a href="https://www.caa.lk/en/drones" target="_blank">CAASL’s official geo-zone maps</a>, NOTAMs, and <a href="https://www.dji.com/flysafe/geo-system" target="_blank">DJI’s GEO advisory system</a> to avoid prohibited polygons and secure unlocks for authorization zones. This diligence ensures legal compliance and safety<sup><a href="#citation-2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>6. What safety protocols and operational procedures do you follow?</h2>
<p>Safety is paramount. Reputable pilots conduct thorough pre-flight planning: site surveys to identify take-off/landing spots, weather briefings, obstacle assessments, and risk-mitigation plans. During flights, they maintain visual line-of-sight (VLOS), use spotters in crowded environments, monitor battery reserves closely, and execute emergency-landing protocols if needed<sup><a href="#citation-4">4</a></sup><sup><a href="#citation-5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>7. Do you carry third-party liability insurance, and what does it cover?</h2>
<p>All Category A–C drones must carry CAASL-mandated third-party liability coverage, starting at LKR 100 000 for lightweight drones and scaling with weight. Clients should request proof of policy declarations and endorsements before the shoot. This insurance protects against potential damages to property or persons during operations<sup><a href="#citation-6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>8. What deliverables can I expect, and what is the turnaround time?</h2>
<p>Deliverables typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-resolution aerial photographs (RAW and JPEG)</li>
<li>Edited 4K video clips with color grading</li>
<li>Optional products such as orthomosaic maps or 360° panoramas</li>
</ul>
<p>Operators usually provide an online download link within 3–7 days of the shoot. Confirm the exact formats, resolution, file sizes, and any revision allowances in your service agreement<sup><a href="#citation-3">3</a></sup><sup><a href="#citation-7">7</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>9. How are your services priced, and are there additional fees?</h2>
<p>Pricing depends on factors such as flight duration, complexity of shots, equipment requirements, travel logistics, and permit fees. Clients should clarify travel expenses, per-hour or per-project rates, and any surcharges for off-road locations. A transparent quote will itemize all costs—operator fees, CAASL application charges, insurance, and editing—so there are no hidden surprises<sup><a href="#citation-8">8</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>10. What is your policy on weather-related changes and rescheduling?</h2>
<p>Tropical weather in Sri Lanka can be unpredictable, with sudden showers and strong winds affecting flight safety. Operators often include flexible rescheduling clauses for weather-related cancellations. It is standard practice to monitor forecasts up to the shoot date, maintain standby days for backup, and confirm go/no-go decisions at least 12–24 hours in advance to ensure optimal conditions<sup><a href="#citation-4">4</a></sup><sup><a href="#citation-8">8</a></sup>.</p>
