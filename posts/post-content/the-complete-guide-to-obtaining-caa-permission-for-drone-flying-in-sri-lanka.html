<p>The <a href="https://www.caa.lk/en/drones" target="_blank">Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL)</a> has established comprehensive regulations for drone operations that require careful navigation through a structured approval process. Recent regulatory updates in March 2025 have refined the classification system and streamlined certain procedures, making it essential for drone operators to understand both the registration requirements and operational authorization processes<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. The permission framework varies significantly based on drone specifications, intended use, and operational complexity, with different pathways for recreational users versus commercial operators<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. Understanding these requirements is crucial for legal compliance, as violations can result in serious legal consequences, particularly when operating near sensitive areas such as military installations, religious sites, or national parks<sup><a href="#source-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Drone Classification and Registration Requirements</h2>
<h3>Understanding the Mass Categories</h3>
<p>Sri Lanka's drone regulations are built around a systematic classification approach that divides unmanned aircraft into specific categories based on their maximum take-off mass (MTOM). The current regulatory framework, updated in March 2025, establishes six primary categories: C0 (under 250g), C1 (250g to 900g), C2 (900g to 4kg), C3 (4kg to 25kg), C4 (25kg and above), and C25+ (specialized category for aircraft over 25kg)<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. This classification system determines not only registration requirements but also operational limitations and approval processes that operators must follow.</p>
<p>The registration mandate applies differently across these categories, with particular emphasis on data-capturing capabilities. Any UAS falling within Categories C1, C2, C3, and C25+ must be registered with CAASL regardless of their sensor equipment<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. Additionally, drones in Categories C0 and C4 that are fitted with sensors capable of capturing data require mandatory registration, reflecting the authority's focus on privacy and security concerns<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. Privately built drones present unique considerations, with all units above 250g MTOM requiring registration, while those at or below 250g need registration only if equipped with data-capturing sensors<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Registration Validity and Renewal Process</h3>
<p>The registration system operates on a five-year validity cycle, providing operators with reasonable operational continuity while ensuring regular compliance reviews<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. This extended validity period represents a significant improvement from earlier frameworks and reduces administrative burden for legitimate operators. The renewal process requires operators to maintain current documentation and demonstrate continued compliance with evolving safety standards.</p>
<p>Registration documentation must be carried during all flight operations, creating a direct accountability link between the operator and the aircraft<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. This requirement extends beyond simple identification to encompass proof of insurance, operational authorizations, and compliance with local jurisdictions. The CAASL has established digital systems to facilitate this process, with the official drone approval portal accessible at <a href="https://portal.caa.lk/" target="_blank">portal.caa.lk</a> providing streamlined access to registration services<sup><a href="#source-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Operational Categories and Approval Processes</h2>
<h3>Open Category Operations</h3>
<p>The 'open' category represents the most accessible pathway for drone operations, designed for lower-risk activities that can proceed under standardized conditions. Operations qualify for this category only when the unmanned aircraft has a maximum take-off mass below 25kg and belongs to specific categories outlined in regulatory annexes, excluding the C25+ classification<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. This framework allows for more streamlined approval processes while maintaining essential safety standards.</p>
<p>Open category operations still require compliance with fundamental safety requirements, including visual line-of-sight maintenance, altitude restrictions typically limited to 120 meters, and minimum distance requirements of 50 meters from people and buildings<sup><a href="#source-3">3</a></sup>. These operations must also secure necessary approvals from local governing authorities for specific geographical zones, ensuring coordination with ground-based activities and local security concerns<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Specific Category Authorizations</h3>
<p>The 'specific' category addresses more complex operations that exceed open category limitations but don't require full certification. These operations demand comprehensive risk assessment and detailed mitigation strategies that CAASL evaluates before granting operational authorization<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. The authority examines whether operational safety objectives appropriately address identified risks and whether proposed mitigation measures provide adequate protection throughout all flight phases.</p>
<p>Specific category authorizations require extensive documentation, including detailed operational risk assessments, competency demonstrations for operators and remote pilots, and technical specifications for the unmanned aircraft system<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. The authorization details operational limitations, required competencies, location restrictions, and reporting requirements, creating a comprehensive framework for safe operations beyond standard parameters. Processing these applications involves thorough evaluation that may extend several weeks, necessitating advance planning for time-sensitive operations<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Certified Category Requirements</h3>
<p>The certified category applies to the most complex operations, requiring both UAS certification and operator licensing. These operations typically involve large aircraft, operations over populated areas, or transport of people or dangerous goods<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. The certification process encompasses rigorous technical evaluations, operational procedure reviews, and ongoing compliance monitoring that parallel traditional aviation certification standards.</p>
<h2>Application Process and Required Documentation</h2>
<h3>Initial Application Submission</h3>
<p>The formal application process begins with Form CAA/AS/017, the "Application for Operation of Pilotless Aircraft," which must be completed in English block capitals and submitted to the Director General of Civil Aviation<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. The submission can be made through postal mail to the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka at 152/1 Minuwangoda Road, Katunayaka, or via email to designated addresses including <a href="mailto:mgraaii@caa.lk">mgraaii@caa.lk</a> and <a href="mailto:amaai@caa.lk">amaai@caa.lk</a><sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. This comprehensive form captures essential operator information, aircraft specifications, and operational intentions.</p>
<p>The application requires detailed operator information including full legal names, national identity card numbers for Sri Lankan citizens or passport numbers for foreign nationals, and complete contact details<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. For commercial operations, additional business registration documentation and accountable manager designation become mandatory, while personal use applications may designate these fields as not applicable<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. The form also captures specific aircraft information including manufacturer details, model specifications, serial numbers, and total aircraft weight including batteries and propellers.</p>
<h3>Essential Supporting Documentation</h3>
<p>Beyond the primary application form, operators must compile extensive supporting documentation that varies based on operational category and intended use. Security clearance from the Office of the Chief of Defence Staff (OCDS) represents a mandatory requirement for all applications, reflecting the security-sensitive nature of aerial operations in Sri Lankan airspace<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. This clearance process can add significant time to the overall approval timeline and requires separate coordination with defense authorities.</p>
<p>Additional clearances may be required depending on operational locations and activities. Archaeological Department clearance becomes necessary for operations near historical sites, while Forest Department approval is required for flights in or near protected forest areas<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. Commercial filming operations require clearance from the relevant filming cooperation authorities, ensuring compliance with media regulations and cultural sensitivity requirements<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. The application must also include proof of appropriate insurance coverage and payment of prescribed fees, documented through official payment receipts<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Geographic and Temporal Specifications</h3>
<p>Applications must include detailed operational planning that specifies exact locations, districts, dates, and time periods for all intended flights<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. This granular level of detail allows authorities to coordinate with local jurisdictions and identify potential conflicts with other airspace users or ground activities. The geographic specification requirement extends beyond simple location naming to include precise coordinates and operational boundaries where applicable.</p>
<p>The temporal specification component requires operators to define specific time periods for operations, typically expressed in terms of daily operational windows (a.m. to p.m.) and overall project duration<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. This information enables authorities to issue time-limited approvals that align with operational needs while maintaining oversight capabilities. Operators planning extended or recurring operations may need to submit multiple applications or request extended authorization periods.</p>
<h2>Local Authority Coordination and Clearances</h2>
<h3>Police Authorization Requirements</h3>
<p>The regulatory framework mandates coordination with local police authorities for most drone operations, particularly those involving data-capturing equipment. Any drone equipped with cameras or other sensors that could potentially pose safety or security threats requires prior authorization from the local police chief responsible for the operational area<sup><a href="#source-1">1</a></sup>. This requirement reflects concerns about privacy, security, and potential misuse of aerial surveillance capabilities.</p>
<p>However, the police authorization requirement includes specific exemptions that can streamline the approval process for legitimate operators. Authorization from local police becomes unnecessary when operators possess written approval from airports within the operational region or when operations occur under direct supervision of authorized CAASL personnel<sup><a href="#source-1">1</a></sup>. These exemptions recognize the overlapping jurisdictions and provide pathways for expedited approval when appropriate oversight already exists.</p>
<h3>Airport and Airspace Coordination</h3>
<p>Operations near airports or within controlled airspace require additional coordination to ensure safe integration with manned aircraft operations. The proximity requirements and coordination procedures vary based on airport classifications and local air traffic patterns. International airports typically maintain larger restricted zones and more complex coordination requirements compared to smaller domestic airfields.</p>
<p>The coordination process involves submitting operational plans to relevant airport authorities and obtaining written approval that demonstrates compatibility with existing air traffic procedures. This approval process may require detailed technical discussions about operational altitudes, timing restrictions, and communication protocols. In some cases, operators may need to coordinate directly with air traffic control services to ensure real-time deconfliction during operations.</p>
<h2>Processing Timeline and Approval Considerations</h2>
<h3>Standard Processing Expectations</h3>
<p>The approval process timeline varies significantly based on operational complexity and completeness of submitted documentation. Open category operations with complete documentation packages typically receive faster processing compared to specific or certified category applications<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. However, even straightforward applications should anticipate processing periods of several weeks, with complex operations potentially requiring months for comprehensive evaluation<sup><a href="#source-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The processing timeline includes multiple review stages, beginning with administrative completeness checks and progressing through technical evaluations and risk assessments. Security clearance coordination with defense authorities often represents the longest component of the timeline, as these processes operate independently of CAASL's direct control<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. Operators planning time-sensitive operations should initiate the approval process well in advance of intended operational dates.</p>
<h3>Common Application Challenges</h3>
<p>Incomplete documentation represents the most frequent cause of processing delays, with missing security clearances, insufficient technical specifications, or inadequate risk assessments requiring resubmission and additional review cycles. The technical documentation requirements demand precise aircraft specifications, including detailed weight calculations, performance parameters, and equipment inventories that must align with manufacturer specifications<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Geographic and operational specification challenges also create processing complications, particularly when proposed operations overlap multiple jurisdictions or involve sensitive locations. Applications lacking sufficient detail about operational boundaries, altitude restrictions, or temporal limitations may require additional clarification before approval can be granted. The coordination requirements with multiple authorities can create dependencies that extend processing timelines beyond operator expectations.</p>
<h2>Compliance and Operational Restrictions</h2>
<h3>Geographic Limitations and No-Fly Zones</h3>
<p>Sri Lankan airspace includes numerous restricted areas where drone operations are strictly prohibited, regardless of approval status. National parks represent absolute no-fly zones designed to protect wildlife and preserve natural heritage from disturbance<sup><a href="#source-3">3</a></sup>. These restrictions extend beyond park boundaries to include buffer zones that provide additional protection for sensitive ecosystems and wildlife corridors.</p>
<p>Religious and cultural sites receive special protection under the regulatory framework, with restrictions extending to temples, Buddha statues, and other sacred locations<sup><a href="#source-3">3</a></sup>. These prohibitions reflect cultural sensitivity requirements and recognize the sacred nature of these sites within Sri Lankan society. Military installations and security-related facilities maintain comprehensive no-fly zones with serious legal consequences for violations<sup><a href="#source-3">3</a></sup>. The geographic extent of these restrictions may vary based on facility classification and current security conditions.</p>
<h3>Operational Limitations and Safety Requirements</h3>
<p>All drone operations must maintain visual line-of-sight contact between the remote pilot and the aircraft throughout the flight duration<sup><a href="#source-1">1</a></sup>. This fundamental safety requirement ensures immediate pilot response to unexpected situations and maintains situational awareness of surrounding airspace. The visual line-of-sight requirement effectively limits operational ranges and may require multiple pilot positions for extended area coverage.</p>
<p>Speed limitations restrict drone operations to maximum velocities of 87 knots (100 mph), ensuring controllability and compatibility with emergency response procedures<sup><a href="#source-1">1</a></sup>. Environmental conditions also impose operational restrictions, with prohibitions on flights during inclement weather or when visibility drops below 5 kilometers (3 miles)<sup><a href="#source-1">1</a></sup>. These weather restrictions prioritize safety while recognizing the limitations of small unmanned aircraft in challenging conditions.</p>
<h3>Insurance and Liability Requirements</h3>
<p>Operational authorization requires demonstration of appropriate insurance coverage that addresses potential liability exposure from drone operations. The insurance requirements vary based on operational risk profiles, with commercial operations typically requiring higher coverage limits compared to recreational use. Proof of insurance must be maintained throughout the operational authorization period and made available during compliance inspections.</p>
<p>The liability framework extends beyond simple property damage to encompass privacy violations, personal injury, and potential security breaches. Operators must confirm compliance with applicable laws regarding privacy protection, data handling, and environmental protection as part of the authorization process<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. This comprehensive approach ensures that drone operations align with broader legal frameworks while maintaining operational flexibility for legitimate activities.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The process of obtaining CAA permission for drone flying in Sri Lanka requires careful navigation through a comprehensive regulatory framework that balances operational flexibility with safety and security concerns. The updated regulations implemented in March 2025 provide clearer guidance while maintaining rigorous oversight of airspace activities<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>. Success in the approval process depends heavily on thorough preparation, complete documentation, and early engagement with the approval process to accommodate extended processing timelines.</p>
<p>Operators must recognize that the permission process extends beyond simple CAASL approval to encompass coordination with multiple authorities including local police, military security services, and relevant specialized agencies based on operational locations and activities<sup><a href="#source-5">5</a></sup>. This multi-jurisdictional approach ensures comprehensive oversight while creating coordination challenges that require advance planning and careful timeline management. The investment in proper approval processes ultimately provides operators with clear legal authority to conduct drone operations while contributing to the safe integration of unmanned aircraft into Sri Lankan airspace.</p>
<p>The regulatory framework continues to evolve as drone technology advances and operational experience grows, making ongoing compliance monitoring essential for continued operational authority. Operators should maintain regular contact with CAASL through the official channels at <a href="mailto:drone@caa.lk">drone@caa.lk</a> or <a href="tel:+94112358819">+94 112 358 819</a> to stay informed of regulatory updates and ensure continued compliance with evolving requirements<sup><a href="#source-4">4</a></sup>. This proactive approach to regulatory compliance supports the sustainable development of drone operations while maintaining the safety and security standards that protect Sri Lankan airspace and communities.</p>
